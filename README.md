# Movie Watchlist

This Movie Watchlist project is built using React, React Router, TailwindCSS and hooks like useEffect, useState, and useContext. The project fetches data from an external API and allows the user to add movies to their watchlist.

### Features:
* User can browse movies and add them to their watchlist.
* The watchlist is stored in local storage, so the user's selection persists even after refreshing the page.
* The user can remove a movie from their watchlist if they change their mind.
* The project uses React Router to enable navigation between different pages.

### TODO:
- [ ]  Improve the design to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.
- [ ]  Fix the search feature so that when the user searches for a movie, they are redirected to the search page.
- [ ]  Add a "watched" section where the user can keep track of the movies they have already watched.
